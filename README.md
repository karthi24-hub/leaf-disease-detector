## 🧠 Model Info

- Framework: **TensorFlow / Keras**
- Architecture: Custom CNN model
- Classes: Tomato Leaf Diseases (e.g., Mosaic Virus, Bacterial Spot, etc.)
- Preprocessed with data augmentation and normalization techniques
- used deep neural network for anaylzing images aslo i done  this with esp 32 cam moduls by detcting the leaf with some colors
